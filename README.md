# Workflow
The scripts were run in the order below (also in [organoid_workflow.sh](https://github.com/redgar598/DNAm_organoid_passage/tree/master/scripts/organoid_workflow.sh))

Below links connect to notebook style outputs (html for R and ipynb for python code). The raw scripts are all available as well [here](https://github.com/redgar598/DNAm_organoid_passage/tree/master/scripts).

# Environment used for analysis
The environment used is org_pass and can be created through the environment from [yml](https://github.com/redgar598/DNAm_organoid_passage/tree/master/org_pass.yml) file.
```
conda env create -f org_pass.yml
```

Unfortunately some key packages did not get exported to yml. So they can be installed through conda and R.
```
conda activate org_pass

conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-bumphunter
BiocManager::install("rtracklayer") # and update none
BiocManager::install("GEOmetadb") # and update none
install.packages("here")
```

For these packages  used versions

bumphunter_1.24.5

rtracklayer_1.42.1

GEOmetadb_1.44.0


Also I installed "here" but just to manage the pathways for rendering of these markdown documents.
```
install.packages("here")
```
Version here_0.1

The data folder referenced in the analysis is not on github. However, all data used will be linked here once deposited pubically.
