# Environment used for analysis
The envrionment used is org_pass and can be created through the environment from yml file.
```
conda env create -f org_pass.yml
```

Unfortunately some key packages did not get exported to yml. So they can be installed through conda and R.
```
conda activate org_pass

conda install -c bioconda bioconductor-bumphunter
BiocManager::install("rtracklayer") # and update none
BiocManager::install("GEOmetadb") # and update none
install.packages("here")
```

For these packages  used versions

bumphunter_1.24.5

rtracklayer_1.42.1

GEOmetadb_1.44.0


Also I installed "here" but just to manage the pathways for rendering of these markdown documents.
```
install.packages("here")
```
Version here_0.1
